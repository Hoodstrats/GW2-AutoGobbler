##### Simple Corn Gobbler Auto Clicker
---
This is a simple Auto Clicker specifically made with Guild Wars 2 in mind. Some of 
the program's short comings such as having to have your cursor on top of the item at 
all times were purposely put in place to stay within Guild Wars's TOS.

###### Usage

- Open the program (small CLI program). It'll open up inside your default Windows
Terminal. Follow the onscreen instructions.

leave or alt tab from Guild Wars 2 (this is intentional to stay within the TOS)
